{"question": "A car is being driven , in a straight line and at a uniform speed , towards the base of a vertical tower . The top of the tower is observed from the car and , in the process , it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45 ° to 60 ° . After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower ?\n\nChoose the correct answer from the following options:\nA ) 5 ( √ 3 + 1 )\nB ) 6 ( √ 3 + √ 2 )\nC ) 7 ( √ 3 – 1 )\nD ) 8 ( √ 3 – 2 )\nE ) None of these", "answer": "Explanation :\nLet the height of the building be h . Initially , he was at an angle of 450 . tan 45 = h / distance between car and tower . h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1) .\nNow , after 10 minutes , it travelled a certain distance , and angle changed to 600 .\ntan 60 = h / x x = h / √ 3\nSo , in 10 minutes , it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h / √ 3 .\n10 minutes = h * (1 – 1 √ 3)\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1 √ 3) .\nTo travel a distance of x , which is h / √ 3 , it takes :\nh = 10 / (1 – 1 / √ 3)\nh / √ 3 = 10 / √ 3 * (1 – 1 / √ 3) . Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √ 3 (conjugate of 1 - √ 3) . We get , x = h / √ 3 = 10 (1 + √ 3) / 2 = 5 * (1 + √ 3)\nSo , it takes 5 (1 + √ 3) minutes to reach the base of the tower .\nAnswer : A\n#### A"}

Let ' s assume that ` ` a ' ' is not a prime number . Let a = kp , where both k and p are positive integers .\nThus , Q = (kp) 4 = k 4 ∗ p 4 (kp) 4 = k 4 ∗ p 4 . Now the number of factors of Q = (4 + 1) * (4 + 1) = 25 . But as the given condition states that Q has ONLY 5 factors , thus ` ` a ' ' ca n ' t have any other factor except 1 and itself . Thus , a = prime number .\nStatement I : We can represent Q = (a ^ 2) ^ 2 . Thus , we have to prove whether a ^ 2 is a prime number . Take a = 2 . We can see that it is not a prime number . Thus , this option ca n ' t answer a ` ` MUST be true question ' '\nStatement II : Always true as proved above .\nStatement III : Again take a = 2 . Thus , Q = 64 . We do n ' t have this as product of 2 primes .\nThe Answer is , B .\n#### B"}
